# BEATS

This is a rhythm machine for the GMSN! Sequencer. Three patterns are stored in the program and can be selected by the mode switch.

When running the voltage out is set by the sliders (aa per a sequencer) so can be hooked to a VCA to giv accent , VFC for motion filtering etc. 


The Direction switch set the pattern:

Left Beat 1
Right Beat 2
Center play sequence of beats.

To calculate the beat patterns array, use the BeatCalc Excel file.
